=========
Transtats
=========

In a software release cycle, localisation steps like extracting or updating language resource, pushing them to translation platform, pulling and packaging translations, quality checks etc. seem necessary but sometimes they lack attention which results in delay. Transtats is an attempt to tie up loose ends and then, may be automate some of the steps. Concept is based on syncing with Translation Platform for statistics, comparing stats with Release Streams, managing translation differences, keep upstream updated and create notifications.

Purpose
-------

To be a catalyst in *localisation of applications* by creating mapping between upstream, translation platform and release streams.
